 Wearables and augmented humans:
 
 improve human performance and help us live healthier,
 safer, more efficient lives.
 In the future, we may even see humans merge with 
 technology to create “augmented humans” or “transhumans.”
 
 
 
 Big Data and augmented analytics:
 
 exponential growth in the amount of data being created in our world.
 Thanks to augmented analytics (highly advanced data analytics, often fueled by AI techniques)
 
 
  Intelligent spaces and smart places:
  
  
   Closely linked to the IoT, 
   this trend is seeing physical spaces.
   
   
   Blockchains and distributed ledgers :
   
   
   This super-secure method of storing,
   authenticating, and protecting data could revolutionize 
   many aspects of business – 
   particularly when it comes to facilitating trusted transactions.
   
    Cloud and edge computing:
    
    
    where data is stored on other computers and accessed via the internet 
    – has helped to open up data and analytics to the masses.
    
    
    Natural language processing:
    
     machines to understand human language, has dramatically changed 
     how humans interact with machines, in particular giving rise to…
     
     
      Robots and cobots:
      
      
      learning to respond to their environment and 
      perform tasks without human intervention. In certain industries, the future of work
      is likely to involve humans working seamlessly with robot
      colleagues – hence the term “cobot," or "collaborative robot.
      
      
      Drones and unmanned aerial vehicle:
      
      
      
      These aircraft, which are piloted either remotely 
      or autonomously, have changed the face of military operations.
      But the impact doesn’t stop there – search and rescue missions,
      firefighting, law enforcement,
      and transportation will all be transformed by drone technology.
      Get ready for passenger drones (drone taxis), too!
